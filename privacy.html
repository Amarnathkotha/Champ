**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Scoring App ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What Data We Collect

The Scoring App collects and stores the following information locally on your device:

- **Game Sessions**: Game names, creation dates, round counts, and archive status

- **Win Conditions**: Your selected win condition (highest/lowest score) for each game

### How We Store Your Data

**All data is stored locally on your device using browser localStorage.** This means:

- Your data never leaves your device

- Provide game statistics and analytics within the app

## Data Retention

- Your data remains on your device indefinitely unless you manually delete it
- You can clear all app data by clearing your browser's localStorage for this website
- Archived games remain in storage until you manually delete them
- Deleting the app or clearing browser data will permanently remove all your information

## Your Rights and Controls

## Children's Privacy

The Scoring App does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since all data is stored locally and we have no access to user data, we cannot determine the age of our users. Parents and guardians should supervise children's use of the app.

## Data Security

### Local Storage Security

- Access is limited to the app's domain
- Security depends on your device's security and browser's implementation

### Recommendations for Users

- Keep your browser updated
- Use trusted devices when accessing the app

## Data Breaches

Since we do not collect, store, or have access to any user data on our servers:

- There is no central database to breach
- Your data security depends entirely on your device security
- We cannot notify you of breaches as we have no contact information
- We recommend backing up important data manually

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
